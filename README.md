# stazione_meteo

A simple 3D printed weather station made with Arduino Uno WiFi. It allows you to measure humidity, temperature and check if it is raining. It also warns you when it starts to rain. Arduino contains the code for the telegram bot, which is responsible for sending a message when it rains and providing buttons to request the temperature and humidity in real time.

The station is designed and printed with a 3D printer using petg plastic. The temperature and humidity sensor is a DHT11. The rain sensor mounted on top is an analogue water sensor.

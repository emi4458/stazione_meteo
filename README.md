# stazione_meteo

A simple 3D printer-printed weather station made with Arduino Uno WiFi. It allows you to measure humidity in the air, temperature and check if it is raining. It also warns you when it starts to rain. 
Arduino contains the code for the telegram bot that is responsible for sending a message when it rains and providing buttons to request the temperature and humidity in real time.

The station is designed and printed with 3D printer using petg plastic. The temperature and humidity sensor is DHT11. The rain sensor mounted at the top is an analog water sensor.
